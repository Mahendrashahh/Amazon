# Amazon Clone UI (HTML + CSS + JS)

Creating a clone of a platform like **Amazon** is not an easy task — especially as a learner. This project represents my personal learning journey into **frontend web development**, using just **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little bit of **JavaScript**.

> It's not a full website with backend or real product listings — it's a UI-only static clone, built with care and effort as a student project.

## 😅 Why this was hard (as a learner)

- Recreating Amazon's layout from scratch took hours of CSS adjustments
- Making it responsive for mobile devices without using Bootstrap or Tailwind
- Matching fonts, colors, and spacing with the original site
- Debugging layout overflow issues and alignment problems

Yet, step-by-step, line-by-line — it came together! 🚀
